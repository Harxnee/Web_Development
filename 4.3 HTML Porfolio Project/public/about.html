<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>
  I’d love to describe myself as a passion-driven and motivated individual who always looks up for opportunities to grow and excel. To me, success is a journey rather than a destination and I always take failure as a feedback mechanism to review my progress and proceed in the right direction. I love to be a team player without losing my individuality and accountability, and always look forward to interact with more people to get in touch with different view-points. I am an enthusiastic person who is willing to go above and beyond on any project, and to learn valuable skills on my own time. For example, I have always deep dived and searched for courses that would help me upskill myself and I’m currently pursuing a lot of them with a never-ending thirst to learn more and broaden my horizon including the google IT support course.

<p>I have also been selected as one among the top 250 peers in the women engineers’ program offered by Talentsprint and supported by google out of 30,000 applications across the country roughly. I always look forward to taking up new challenges that question my potential and raise my bars accordingly. I strongly believe that the programs that I'm a part of would definitely provide me a great opportunity to be a part of a like-minded community and would help me in channelising my goals and energy in the right direction. </p>

<p>Hoping to make most out of it and keep learning more in this amazing tech journey!</p>
